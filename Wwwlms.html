Departmental and college addresses and phone numbers may be found on individual college and departmental websites.If you have a question you would like to ask, including admission queries, please use our “Any Questions” website. You can search popular questions or submit a question using the “Ask a question” tab. Unfortunately we are unable to respond to letters from individuals.

If you have an issue or feedback relating to the University of Oxford website itself, please contact the webmaster.</h3></p>

<h2>History <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lovely_Professional_University&action=edit&section=1">[edit]</a></h2><h3>The study of History at Oxford combines the examination of large regions over extended periods of time with more focused work on smaller groups, shorter periods and particular problems. It provides a distinctive education by developing an awareness of differing political, cultural, social and economic structures in past societies and their interrelationship. It combines vigorous debate over questions of interpretation with rigorous attention to the source materials. Its constant enrichment by cross-fertilisation from other disciplines leads to new questions about the past.
